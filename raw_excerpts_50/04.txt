ATT	 Excellent. I have a question for you. How do I find out the cost center for a particular department?
VIC	 You’d have to get ahold of the budget analyst for the department.
ATT	 Do you know who’d be the budget analyst for Thousand Oaks— headquarters? I’m trying to fill out a form and I don’t know the proper cost center.
VIC	 I just know when y’all need a cost center number, you call your budget analyst.
ATT	 Do you have a cost center for your department there in Texas?
VIC	 We have our own cost center but they don’t give us a complete list of them.
ATT	 How many digits is the cost center? For example, what’s your cost center?
