VIC	Hi *****, my name is Jules. How can I help you?
ATT	Hi Jules!
VIC	Good day!
ATT	My flex 2 is charged but won't turn on! Is it normal?
VIC	No worries now, I'm here to help you get your Flex 2 to turn on. To begin with my investigation, may I know the email address linked to your Fitbit account?
ATT	Sure! ****************
VIC	Perfect! Allow me a minute here as I review your account.
VIC	As I do so, may I know the troubleshoots you've already performed to get it to work again?
ATT	 Sure, I've read the articles on the Fitbit help center and followed the steps, as well as checking out the community forums.
ATT	Tried to restart my flex but with no results
VIC	I appreciate your doing all of this prior to contacting us, *****.
ATT	Thank you.
VIC	I can see that its last successful sync was yesterday at 6:09 PM using an Android device and its battery level then is at 65%.
ATT	Yes, that's right
VIC	Thanks for confirming!
VIC	 I can also see that its firmware is up to date so that shouldn't be a problem.
VIC	May I know now how your Flex 2 reacts when you connect it to its charger to charge? Any vibrations or light up on its display?
ATT	Nothing at all
ATT	Like if the flex 2 was dead
VIC	 I hear you. We may need to restart your tracker three consecutive times to make sure we refresh its system.
VIC	How does that sound?
ATT	I'm going to try it
VIC	Alright! You may properly do so by following the instructions in this article: http://help.fitbit.c..._article/1186/
VIC	Let me know how it goes. I'm crossing my fingers here.
ATT	Crossing mine too !
VIC	 Let's hope for the best result.
ATT	 Uuhh no results :/ it won't turn on
VIC	 I appreciate your effort, *****.
VIC	 Have you tried cleaning their contacts? You may also refer here for the cleaning instructions: http://help.fitbit.c...p_article/2005
ATT	Thank you, i'm going to try it now.
VIC	Thank you too for troubleshooting this with me today.
ATT	So i've cleaned the charging contact with rubbing alcohol. I'm trying to turn it on
ATT	 aaaand no results :'(
VIC	Don't be sad now. Let's proceed with other solutions I have here.
ATT	Sure! Thanks alot!
VIC	Do you happen to see any damage on the tracker and charging cable? Any damage on their charging contacts, perhaps?
VIC	Sure thing, *****.
ATT	No, I don't think so.
VIC	That's good. How about when you connect it to its charger, is the contact secure or loose?
ATT	The contact is secure
VIC	Perfect. Have you tried using a different Flex 2 charger if possible? This is for us to know if it's the tracker or the charger that's the culprit.
ATT	I've tried my wife's charger this morning and it didn't work
ATT	 Do you want me to re-try ?
VIC	 Oh yes, please if you may. This may make changes after we cleaned the contacts.
VIC	Thank you!
ATT	Sure!
VIC	 I hope this one works.
ATT	No results, like this morning.
ATT	Uuh :/
VIC	Thank you again for your efforts.
ATT	 Thank you for helping me!
VIC	 The pleasure is mine.
VIC	Since we've exhausted all the necessary troubleshoots, I'd like to move forward now and review your tracker's warranty status. May I know your current country of residence?
ATT	 Sure, i'm actually in Spain.
VIC	Wonderful! I always wish to visit there one day.
VIC	 May I also know when and where you purchased it?
ATT	Got it for my birthday on December 2016
ATT	End of november*
VIC	That's a sweet gift you have there, *****. Allow me a minute now to review its warranty for you.
ATT	Thank you!
VIC	Alright!
VIC	How's your day so far, by the way?
ATT	Really good! I was planning to go to the forest today
ATT	 How's yours ?
VIC	 Awesome! Mine's wonderful, just getting ready for the weekend.
VIC	I have great news for you, *****.
VIC	Upon checking, I can see that your Flex 2 is still covered by Fitbit's limited warranty.
ATT	That's wonderful!
VIC	I’ll be sending you an email containing your replacement offer on the email address associated to your Fitbit account. How does that sound?
ATT	Perfect! Thanks alot!!
VIC	Agreed! Glad to know your happy.
VIC	By the way, after our chat you will receive a brief survey. Any feedback you'd like to provide would be most appreciated and will help us refine our support processes.
ATT	 Sure thing!
ATT	You're amazing! Thanks again
VIC	Thank you! You too with all the troubleshoots we tried.
VIC	I’d like to make sure that I got you all covered. Is there anything else I can assist you in the meantime?
ATT	 I think everything is good. Thanks!
VIC	Good to know that! I'll send the email after our chat.
VIC	Whenever you're ready to go, please click on ""end chat" at the top right part of this window.
ATT	Thank you, have a nice day, Jules!
VIC	 Enjoy your day and take care! Have a safe trip in the forest!
ATT	Thank you!
