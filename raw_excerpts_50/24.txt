VIC	Human Resources, this is Sarah.
ATT	Hi, Sarah. This is George, in the parking garage. You know the access card you use to get into the parking garage and elevators? Well, we had a problem and we need to reprogram the cards for all the new hires from the last fifteen days.
VIC	So you need their names?
ATT	And their phone numbers.
VIC	I can check our new hire list and call you back. What’s your phone number?
ATT	I’m at 73 . . . Uh, I’m going on break, how about if I call you back in a half-hour?
VIC	Oh. Okay.
	
VIC	Oh, yes. Well, there’s just two. Anna Myrtle, in Finance, she’s a secretary. And that new VP, Mr. Underwood.
ATT	And the phone numbers?
VIC	Right. . . . Okay, Mr. Underwood is 6973. Anna Myrtle is 2127.
ATT	Hey, you’ve been a big help. Thanks.
	
VIC	Finance, Anna speaking.
ATT	I’m glad I found somebody working late. Listen, this is Ron Vittaro, I’m publisher of the business division. I don’t think we’ve been introduced. Welcome to the company.
VIC	Oh, thank you.
ATT	Anna, I’m in Los Angeles and I’ve got a crisis. I need to take about ten minutes of your time.
VIC	Of course. What do you need?
ATT	Go up to my office. Do you know where my office is?
VIC	No.
ATT	Okay, it’s the corner office on the fifteenth floor—room 1502. I’ll call you there in a few minutes. When you get to the office, you’ll need to press the forward button on the phone so my call won’t go directly to my voice mail.
VIC	Okay, I’m on my way now.
