ATT	I’m Mark Sellers, in the registrar’s office. You feel like taking pity on a new guy? Sorry to be calling you but they’re all in a meeting this afternoon and there’s no one around to help me. I need to retrieve a list of all graduates with a computer science degree, between 1990 and 2000. They need it by the end of the day and if I don’t have it, I may not have this job for long. You willing to help out a guy in trouble?” Helping people out was part of what this database administra- tor did, so he was extra patient as he talked Michael step by step through the process.
