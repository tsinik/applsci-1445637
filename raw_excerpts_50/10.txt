VIC	Electron City. This is Ted.
ATT	Hi, Ted. This is Adam. Listen, I was in a few nights ago talking to a sales guy about a cell phone. I said I’d call him back when I decided on the plan I wanted, and I forgot his name. Who’s the guy who works in that department on the night shift?
VIC	There’s more than one. Was it William?
ATT	I’m not sure. Maybe it was William. What’s he look like?
VIC	Tall guy. Kind of skinny.
ATT	I think that’s him. What’s his last name, again?
VIC	Hadley. H—A—D—L—E— Y.
ATT	Yeah, that sounds right. When’s he going to be on?
VIC	Don’t know his schedule this week, but the evening people come in about five.
ATT	Good. I’ll try him this evening, then. Thanks, Ted.
	
ATT	Katie, hi. This is William Hadley, over at the West Girard store. How’re you today?
VIC	Little slow, what’s up?
ATT	I’ve got a customer who came in for that one-cent cell phone program. You know the one I mean?
VIC	Right. I sold a couple of those last week.
ATT	You still have some of the phones that go with that plan?
VIC	Got a stack of them.
ATT	Great. Cause I just sold one to a customer. The guy passed credit; we signed him up on the contract. I checked the damned inventory and we don’t have any phones left. I’m so embarrassed. Can you do me a favor? I’ll send him over to your store to pick up a phone. Can you sell him the phone for one cent and write him up a receipt? And he’s supposed to call me back once he’s got the phone so I can talk him through how to program it.
VIC	Yeah, sure. Send him over.
ATT	Okay. His name is Ted. Ted Yancy.
