ATT	That’s the one, I’m looking for the affidavit and copy of the warrant.
VIC	Oh, I have it right here.
ATT	AGreat, Listen, I’m out in the field and I have a meeting with the Secret Service on this case in fifteen minutes. I’ve been so absent- minded lately, I left the file at home, and I’ll never make it there and back in time. Could I get copies from you?
VIC	"Sure, no problem. I’ll make copies; you can come right over and pick them up.
ATT	Great, That’s great. But listen, I’m on the other side of town. Is it possible you could fax them to me?
	
VIC	We don’t have a fax up here in Records, But they have one downstairs in the Clerk’s office they might let me use.
ATT	Let me call the Clerk’s office and set it up.
VIC	Who’s going to pay for it?
ATT	I’ll get the code and call you back,” he told her
	
ATT	What’s the accounting code for the DA’s office?
