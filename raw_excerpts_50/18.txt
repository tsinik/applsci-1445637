VIC	Mod Three. This is May Linn Wang.
ATT	Ms. Wang, this is Arthur Arondale, in the Office of the Inspector General. Can I call you ‘May’?
VIC	It’s ‘May Linn’,” she said.
ATT	Well, it’s like this, May Linn. We’ve got a new guy in here who there’s no computer for yet, and right now he’s got a priority project and he’s using mine. We’re the government of the United States, for cryin’ out loud, and they say they don’t have enough money in the budget to buy a computer for this guy to use. And now my boss thinks I’m falling behind and doesn’t want to hear any excuses, you know?
VIC	I know what you mean, all right.
ATT	Can you help me with a quick inquiry on MCS?” he asked, using the name of the computer system for looking up taxpayer information.
VIC	Sure, what’cha need?
