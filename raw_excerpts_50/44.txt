ATT	Hi Josie, unfortunately we’ve detected that the machine you’re working on has been used to browse, well shall we say, indecent websites?
VIC	Well it certainly wasn’t me! How dare you
ATT	Hmm...well there are filters that should block any sites like that, perhaps your machine has been compromised in some way?
ATT	Could you browse to a few company sites for me so I can check the traffic and find out what’s going?
