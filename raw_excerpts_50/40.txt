VIC	Hi Lucia, My name is Angel. How can I help you?
ATT	Hello Angel, i'm sorry for interrupting you, but i'm experiencing a problem with my Charge 2
VIC	Oh, you're not interrupting me at all Lucia. How can I help you with your Charge 2?
ATT	So, I have been very busy with moving from the USA to the Netherlands, and I was able to work out again, when I tried to turn on the Charge 2, I saw that the battery was leaking
VIC	Oh, no. I am so sorry that your Charge 2's battery is leaking.
VIC	I will try my best to help you with this.
VIC	For me to get started, can you confirm to me the email associated with your Fitbit account?‚Äù
ATT	Thank you a lot
ATT	Sure! The email is ************
VIC	Thank you.
VIC	Please stay on the line while I check this out.
ATT	Alright
ATT	Take your time
VIC	Upon checking your account, I see that your Charge 2 was paired on March 27, 2017.
VIC	May I know where you purchased this?
ATT	I got it as a gift, from my mom, when I still lived in the USA
VIC	Thanks for that information. Can you also confirm to me what country are you in right now?
ATT	Currently I am in the Netherlands
VIC	Thank you for all those information Lucia.
ATT	No problem Angel, I am just worried about my Charge 2
VIC	Since your Charge 2's battery is leaking and it is still covered by Fitbit's warranty, I forwarded your case to the higher department so that they can determine what can be done to your case next. You will be contacted by them to your email address, ********** as soon as they have reviewed the case and help you claim your Fitbit tracker's warranty.
VIC	You have access to this email, right?
ATT	Yes I do have acces to this email
VIC	That's perfect. Please wait for their email with instructions on what to do next with your Charge 2 because they are the appropriate team for such case.
VIC	In case you'd like to follow up, the case number is **********.
ATT	How long do you think it will take before I get an email?
VIC	Rest assured that they will be able to read the chat transcript as well as the documentation in your case.
VIC	Expect an email within 48-72 hours from now since they would have to review your case first.
ATT	Alright, thank you a lot Angel, can you maybe send me a confirmation email
VIC	You're welcome. Let me compose it now to make sure that you'll get it.
ATT	Okay, take your time!
VIC	I'm almost done typing.
VIC	Thanks for your patience.
VIC	I have sent the email. Kindly check if you received it.
ATT	I have received it, thank you, I hope I will have a replacement soon and be able to train again!
VIC	You're welcome! I hope to get you on track again too!
VIC	For now, is there anything else that I may assist you with?
ATT	I don't think so, thank you for your time!
VIC	Thank you as well, Lucia! Please take care always and enjoy the rest of the week!
VIC	Cheers!
