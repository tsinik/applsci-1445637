ATT	This is Eduardo in the Billing Department. I’ve got a lady on hold, she’s a secretary in the executive offices that works for one of the vice pres- idents, and she’s asking for some information and I can’t use my computer. I got an email from this girl in Human Resources that said ‘ILOVEYOU,’ and when I opened the attachment, I couldn’t use my machine any more. A virus. I got caught by a stupid virus. Anyways, could you look up some customer information for me?
VIC	Sure,” J“It crashed your computer? That’s terrible.
ATT	Yeah.
