ATT	Hi,This is Tom at Parkhurst Travel. Your tickets to San Francisco are ready. Do you want us to deliver them, or do you want to pick them up?
VIC	San Francisco?” Peter says. “I’m not going to San Francisco.
ATT	Is this Peter Abels?
VIC	Yes, but I don’t have any trips coming up.
ATT	Well, you sure you don’t want to go to San Francisco?
VIC	If you think you can talk my boss into it ...
ATT	Sounds like a mix-up, On our system, we book travel arrangements under the employee number. Maybe somebody used the wrong number. What’s your employee number?
	
ATT	Hi Sarah, It’s Jim in finance, how’s things?
VIC	Hi Jim, fine thank you, what can I do for you?
ATT	Sarah, we have just got updated pay information through from the guys that handle our payroll, and we think a lot of it is wrong. It looks like a lot of the employee number’s don’t match what I have on record
VIC	Uh oh, that doesn’t sound good
ATT	It’s a disaster Sarah, it looks like at least half of them are wrong, including yours, which could mean that people don’t get paid properly
VIC	Oh no! 
ATT	We are trying to correct everybody’s record, and we have got to you in the list, could you read out your employee number so that I can verify that our records are now correct? 
VIC	Sure, it’s 4454536346346
ATT	It looks like yours was correct after all, I’m glad we confirmed it though! Wouldn’t want people without pay come the end of the month!
