ATT	I’ve been out of work for a while, and I finally got an interview here today. I was driving here all nervous, and a cat ran out in front of me. I love cats, and I didn’t want to hit it, so I swerved, and my coffee fell out of its holder onto my seat and drenched my resumes. Fortunately, I missed the cat, but I killed my resumes.
VIC	Oh, that’s terrible. What can I do to help?
ATT	I have my resume on this USB key. Could you print me just one copy, please?
VIC	What’s your name? I can tell Ms. Jones you’re here.
ATT	Paul Williams. I have an 11 o’clock appointment with XYZ.
VIC	Oh, sweetie, you are having a bad day. This is ABC. XYZ is next door.
ATT	I’m so embarrassed! You’ve been so helpful, a lifesaver. I need to run so I won’t be late. Thank you.
