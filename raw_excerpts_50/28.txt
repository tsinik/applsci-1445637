VIC	Tech support. Sylvia speaking. How can I help you?
ATT	Hi. This is James. I just loaded something on my machine that I shouldn’t have. When I ran the virus scan to clean it off, it also erased my VPN credentials. Can you please give me the credentials again?
VIC	Sure, I can help you. Please tell me your full name.
ATT	James Smith. You can call me Jim.
VIC	Jim? Smith?
ATT	Yes.
VIC	Don’t you recognize my voice? This is Sylvia.
ATT	Sylvia, I’m sorry. I’m so stressed. I clicked on this phish and then loaded some bad software. When I tried to clean it, it messed up my machine. My head is spinning. I think I’m getting a cold; that’s why my voice sounds different. And, on top of everything else, I lost my VPN creds. Forgive me and can you please help me?
VIC	Sure. No problem, Jim. Let me pull up your credentials.
