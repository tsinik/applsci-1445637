ATT	I’m calling from R&D Minneapolis. Our server had a worm that infected the whole department. We had to install the operating system again and then when we went to restore from backup, none of the back- ups was any good. Guess who was supposed to be checking the integrity of the backups? Yours truly. So I’m getting yelled at by my boss, and man- agement is up in arms that we’ve lost the data. Look, I need to have the latest revision of the source-code tree as quick as you can. I need you to gzip the source code and send it to me.
