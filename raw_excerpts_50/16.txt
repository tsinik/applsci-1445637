VIC	Ron Hillyard’s office, this is Dorothy.
ATT	Dorothy, hi. My name is Kyle Bellamy. I’ve just come on board to work in Animation Development on Brian Glassman’s staff. You folks sure do things different over here.
VIC	I guess. I never worked on any other movie lot so I don’t really know. What can I do for you?
ATT	To tell you the truth, I’m feeling sort of stupid. I’ve got a writer coming over this afternoon for a pitch session and I don’t know who I’m supposed to talk to about getting him onto the lot. The people over here in Brian’s office are really nice but I hate to keep bothering them, how do I do this, how do I do that. It’s like I just started junior high and can’t find my way to the bathroom. You know what I mean?
VIC	You want to talk to Security. Dial 7, and then 6138. If you get Lauren, tell her Dorothy said she should take good care of you.
ATT	Thanks, Dorothy. And if I can’t find the men’s room, I may call you back!
