ATT	This is Bob Billings. I work in the Secure Communications Group. I’m at home right now and I can’t drive in because of the storm. And the problem is that I need to access my workstation and the server from home, and I left my Secure ID in my desk. Can you go fetch it for me? Or can somebody? And then read off my code when I need to get in? Because my team has a critical deadline and there’s no way I can get my work done. And there’s no way I can get to the office—the roads are much too dangerous up my way.
VIC	I can’t leave the Computer Center.
ATT	Do you have a Secure ID yourself?
VIC	There’s one here in the Computer Center. We keep one for the operators in case of an emergency.
ATT	Listen, Can you do me a big favor? When I need to dial into the network, can you let me borrow your Secure ID? Just until it’s safe to drive in.
VIC	Who are you again?
ATT	Bob Billings.
VIC	Who do you work for?
ATT	For Ed Trenton.
VIC	Oh, yeah, I know him.
ATT	I’m on the second floor, Next to Roy Tucker.
ATT	It’d be much easier just to go to my desk and fetch my Secure ID for me.
VIC	I’ll have to ask my boss. Hang on. “He works for Ed Trenton. Can we let him use the Secure ID in the Computer Center?
VIC	My manager wants to talk to you himself,” and gave him the man’s name and cell phone number.
	
ATT	It’d be easier if someone just goes and fetches my card, I don’t think the desk is locked, it should be there in my upper left drawer.
VIC	Well,just for the weekend, I think we can let you use the one in the Computer Center. I’ll tell the guys on duty that when 87 you call, they should read off the random-access code for you,
	
ATT	My server won’t let me connect,. I need you to set me up with an account on one of the computers in your department so I can use Telnet to connect to my system.
VIC	“call me back when you don’t need it any more and I’ll remove it.
